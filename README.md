I’ve created two HTML dashboards. One of them allows me to input values directly from the dashboard to the IoT Urea RoboNinja platform, while the other is designed to read and display those values on the dashboard itself. The “distance” dashboard is used for reading data, and the “write” dashboard is used for sending or inputting data. However, the system isn’t working properly at the moment.
